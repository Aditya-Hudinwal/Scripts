1. pstree: the pstree command displays the current processes on the system in a tree-like structure.

2. killall: the killall command sends a kill signal to all processes identified by name.

3. fuser: the fuser command identifies the PID of processes that use the specified files or file systems.

4. watch: The watch command regularly executes a command and displays the result in the terminal in full screen.
          -n option allows you to specify the number of seconds between each execution of the command.
   Ex- watch -n 5 tail -n 3 /etc/passwd

5. install: This command combines file copying (cp) and directory creation (mkdir), with rights management (chmod, chown) and other useful functionalities (like backups).

Options	Remarks                          
-b or --backup[=suffix]	create a backup of destination file.
-d    	treat arguments as directory names.              
-D    	create all leading components before copying SOURCE to DEST.
-g and -o    	set ownership.              
-m    	set permissions.              
-p    	preserve the timestamps of sources files.              
-t	copy all source arguments to directory.

Examples:
Create a directory with the -d option: install -d ~/samples
Copy a file from a source location to a directory: install src/sample.txt ~/samples/ 

These two orders could have been carried out with a single command:
 install -v -D -t ~/samples/ src/sample.txt 
install: creating directory '~/samples'
'src/sample.txt' -> '~/samples/sample.txt'

we  can also create a backup of existing files  to the -b option:  install -v -b -D -t ~/samples/ src/sample.txt
